\fBksmbdpwd.db\fR is the user database for \fBksmbd.mountd\fP(8) user mode daemon.

\fBksmbd.control --reload\fR can be used for notifying \fBksmbd.mountd\fR of changes when not using \fBksmbd.adduser\fR.
\fBksmbdpwd.db\fR is expected to be at \fB@sysconfdir@/ksmbd/ksmbdpwd.db\fR by default. \" PATH_PWDDB
