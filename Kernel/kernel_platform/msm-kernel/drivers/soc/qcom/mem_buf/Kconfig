	help
	  Add support for lending memory from one virtual machine to another.
	  This driver communicates with the hypervisor, as well as other
	  virtual machines, to request and lend memory from and to VMs
	  respectively.

	select QCOM_MEM_BUF_DEV_GH
	help
	  Enables additional support for sharing memory with VMs that have their own
	  operating systems, as opposed to peripheral VMs, which do not have their
	  own operating systems. These VMs are managed by the Gunyah Hypervisor, and thus
	  sharing memory with them requires interacting with the Gunyah Hypervisor.
	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Enables support for communicating with VMs over message queues. The communication
	  with the VMs follows a specific communication format that is defined by the mem-buf
	  message queue protocol. The protocol allows for allocation requests to be submitted
	  between VMs, and relinquished when a VM is finished with the memory that it
	  requested from another VM.
	  If unsure, say N.

config QCOM_MEM_BUF_IPA_RESERVE
	bool "Reserve IPA space of certain size from Hypervisor"
	depends on QCOM_MEM_BUF_GH
	help
	  Reserve an IPA space of certain size and range from the
	  Hypervisor which can be used for accepting memory donated
	  by the Primary VM. This IPA space can be used for accepting
	  dmabuf buffers as well.
	  This Kconfig is not needed once required symbols are exported from ACK.
	  If unsure, say N.
