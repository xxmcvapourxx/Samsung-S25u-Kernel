title: Integrated connectivity Platform Driver

description:
   Integrated connectivity platform driver adds support for the Integrated WLAN
   that runs on Q6 based platforms. WLAN FW on these architecture runs on Q6. This
   platform driver communicates with WLAN FW over QMI, WLAN on/off messages
   to FW are communicated thru this interface. This driver also listens to
   WLAN PD restart notifications.
