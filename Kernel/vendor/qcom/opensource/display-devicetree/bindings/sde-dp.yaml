title: SDE DP

description: |
  sde-dp is the master Display Port device which supports DP host controllers that are compatible
  with VESA Display Port interface specification.
  msm_ext_disp is a device which manages the interaction between external
  display interfaces, e.g. Display Port, and the audio subsystem.
  [Optional child nodes]: These nodes are for devices which are
  dependent on msm_ext_disp. If msm_ext_disp is disabled then
  these devices will be disabled as well. Ex. Audio Codec device.
