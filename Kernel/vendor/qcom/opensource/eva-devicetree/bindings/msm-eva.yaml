  Root level node - cvp

properties:
  # A dictionary of DT properties for this binding schema

      - items:

              - qcom,msm-cvp

  reg:
    description:
      offset and length of the CSR register set for the device.
  interrupts:
    description:
      should contain the cvp interrupt.
  qcom,reg-presets:
    description:
      list of offset-value pairs for registers to be written.
      The offsets are from the base offset specified in 'reg'. This is mainly
      used for QoS, VBIF, etc. presets for video.
  qcom,qdss-presets:
    description:
      list of physical address and memory allocation size pairs.
      when fw_debug_mode is set as HFI_DEBUG_MODE_QDSS, all firmware
      messages will be written to QDSS memory.
  ‘*-supply’:
    description:
      A phandle pointing to the appropriate regulator. Number of
      regulators vary across targets.
  clock-names:
    description:
      an array of clocks that the driver is supposed to be
      manipulating. The clocks names here correspond to the clock names
      used in clk_get(<name>).
  qcom,clock-configs:
    description:
      an array of bitmaps of clocks' configurations. The index of the
      bitmap corresponds to the clock at the same index in qcom,clock-names.
      The bitmaps describes the actions that the device needs to take
      regarding the clock (i.e. scale it based on load).
      The bitmap is defined as scalable = 0x1
      (if the driver should vary the clock's frequency based on load)
  qcom,allowed-clock-rates:
    description:
      an array of supported clock rates by the chipset.
  qcom,use-non-secure-pil:
    description:
      A bool indicating which type of pil to use to load the fw.
  qcom,fw-bias:
    description:
      The address at which cvp fw is loaded (manually).
